Conjure

Conjure is a data generator.  You'd use Conjure any time you need to generate a lot of test data.

Building
Conjure is built with maven, so the standard
mvn clean install
will get you a self contained artifact in target/d8a-conjure-*.jar

Configure
To use Conjure, you first need to create a template to show Conjure what your data looks like.  The template is a simple
DSL that tries to be as close to the raw data as possible.  See the Template page for more details.  If you just want
to fire it up and see what it can do, you can use one from the examples directory.

Run
The Conjure firehose will generate data using your template at the rate you specify.  To fire up the firehose run:
bin/firehose examples/simple-template.txt
That will run the firehose for the simple-template.txt template, conjuring up data at 10 samples per second.
You can also specify the rate:
bin/firehose -r 100 examples/simple-template.txt
Will generate at 100 samples per second.
See the Firehose page for more options.
