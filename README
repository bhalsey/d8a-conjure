Conjure

Conjure is a data generator.  You'd use Conjure any time you need to generate a lot of test data.  It can generate piles of data on disk, or emit to kafka queues as a realtime firehose simulator.

Building
Conjure is built with maven, so the standard
mvn clean install
will get you a self contained artifact in target/d8a-conjure-*.jar

Configure
To use Conjure, you first need to create a template to show Conjure what your data looks like.  The template is a simple DSL that tries to be as close to the raw data as possible.  See the Template page for more details.  If you just want to fire it up and see what it can do, you can use one from the examples directory.  They're numbered and commented in an attempt at a tutorial path of sorts.

Run
The Conjurer will generate data using your template at the rate you specify.  To fire up the conjurer run:
bin/conjure examples/01-fixed-data.txt
That will run the generator for the simple-template.txt template, conjuring up data at 10 lines per second.
You can also specify the rate:
bin/conjure -rate 100 examples/01-fixed-data.txt
Will generate at 100 lines per second.
See the Conjurer page for more options.
