{"google":"","body":"###Conjure\r\n\r\nConjure is a data generator.  You'd use Conjure any time you need to generate a lot of test data.  It can generate piles of data on disk, or emit to kafka queues as a realtime firehose simulator.\r\n\r\n###Building\r\nConjure is built with maven, so the standard\r\n\r\n```\r\nmvn clean install\r\n```\r\n\r\nwill get you a self contained artifact in target/d8a-conjure-*.jar\r\n\r\n###Configure\r\nTo use Conjure, you first need to create a template to show Conjure what your data looks like.  The template is a simple DSL that tries to be as close to the raw data as possible.  See the Template page for more details.  If you just want to fire it up and see what it can do, you can use one from the examples directory.  They're numbered and commented in an attempt at a tutorial path of sorts.\r\n\r\n###Run\r\nThe Conjurer will generate data using your template at the rate you specify.  To fire up the conjurer run:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbin/conjure examples/01-fixed-data.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat will run the generator for the simple-template.txt template, conjuring up data at 10 lines per second.\r\nYou can also specify the rate:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbin/conjure -rate 100 examples/01-fixed-data.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\nWill generate at 100 lines per second.\r\nSee the Conjurer page for more options.\r\n","name":"d8a-conjure","note":"Don't delete this file!
